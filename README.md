## What is IPA
 An alphabet developed in the 19th century to accurately represent the pronunciation of languages. One aim of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was to provide a unique symbol for each distinctive sound in a languageâ€”that is, every sound, or phoneme, that serves to distinguish one word from another.
